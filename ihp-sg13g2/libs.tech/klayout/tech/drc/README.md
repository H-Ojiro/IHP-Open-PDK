 ‚îó üìúrun_drc.py                     Main Python script for SG13G2 DRC run.
 ```

## Prerequisites

You need the following set of tools installed to be able to run SG13G2 DRC:

- Python 3.9+
- KLayout 0.29.0+

We have tested this using the following setup:
- Python 3.9.18
- KLayout 0.30.1

## Installation

To install the required Python packages, execute the following command:

```bash
pip install -r ../../../../../requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You have the option to execute the SG13G2-DRC through either a Python script via the command-line interface [CLI](#cli) or by the Klayout graphical user interface [GUI](#gui), as detailed in the subsequent usage sections.

### CLI

The `run_drc.py` script takes your gds to run DRC rule decks with switches to select subsets of all checks.

```bash
    run_drc.py (--help| -h)
    run_drc.py (--path=<file_path>) [--table=<table_name>]... [--mp=<num_cores>] [--run_dir=<run_dir_path>]
    [--topcell=<topcell_name>] [--thr=<thr>] [--run_mode=<run_mode>] [--drc_json=<json_path>] [--no_feol]
    [--no_beol] [--MaxRuleSet] [--no_connectivity] [--density] [--density_only] [--antenna] [--antenna_only]
    [--no_offgrid] [--macro_gen]
```

**Example:**

```bash
    python3 run_drc.py --path=testing/testcases/unit/activ.gds --run_mode=deep --run_dir=test_activ
```

**Options:**

- `--help -h`                           Displays this help message.

- `--path=<file_path>`                  Specifies the file path of the input GDS file.

- `--topcell=<topcell_name>`            Specifies the name of the top cell to be used.

- `--table=<table_name>`                Specifies the name of the table on which to execute the rule deck.

- `--mp=<num_cores> `                   Run the rule deck in parts in parallel to speed up the run. [default: 1]

- `--run_dir=<run_dir_path>`            un directory to save all the generated results [default: pwd]

- `--thr=<thr>`                         Specifies the number of threads to use during the run.

- `--run_mode=<run_mode>`               Selects the allowed KLayout mode, (flat , deep, tiling). [default: deep]

- `--drc_json=<json_path>`              Path to the JSON file that contains the DRC rules values to be used.

- `--no_feol`                           Disables FEOL rules from running.

- `--no_beol`                           Disables BEOL rules from running.

- `--MaxRuleSet`                        Runs DRC using the complete rule deck.

- `--no_connectivity`                   Disables connectivity rules.

- `--density`                           Enables Density rules.

- `--density_only`                      Runs Density rules only.

- `--antenna`                           Enables Antenna checks.

- `--antenna_only`                      Runs Antenna checks only.

- `--no_offgrid`                        Disables OFFGRID checking rules.

- `--macro_gen`                         Generating the full rule deck without run.

> **Note**
> If the `--drc_json=<json_path>` option is not provided, the script will attempt to use the [SG13G2 tech JSON](../../python/sg13g2_pycell_lib/sg13g2_tech.json) file. If that file is missing, it will fall back to the [default tech DRC values](./rule_decks/default_drc_rules.json) file.

#### DRC Outputs

You could find the run results at your run directory if you previously specified it through `--run_dir=<run_dir_path>`. Default path of run directory is `drc_run_<date>_<time>` in current directory.

**Folder Structure of run results**

```text
üìÅ drc_run_<date>_<time>
 ‚î£ üìú drc_run_<date>_<time>.log
 ‚îó üìú main.drc
 ‚îó üìú <your_design_name>.lyrdb
 ```

The outcome includes a database (`<your_design_name>.lyrdb`) containing DRC results. You can view it by opening your gds file with: `klayout <device_name>.gds -m <your_design_name>.lyrdb`. Alternatively, you can visualize it on your GDS file using the netlist browser option in the tools menu of the KLayout GUI as illustrated in the following figures.

After selecting Marker Browser option, you could load the database file and visualize the DRC results.

### GUI

The SG13G2 also facilitates DRC execution via Klayout menus as depicted below:

First, you need to add the DRC menus to your `KLAYOUT_PATH`, you could do that by executing the following command:

```bash
KLAYOUT_PATH=$PDKPATH/libs.tech/klayout:$PDKPATH/libs.tech/klayout/tech/ klayout -e
```

> **_NOTE:_** In this context, `PDKPATH` refers to the path leading to the IHP-Open-PDK/ihp-sg13g2 directory within the current repository.

Then, you will get the DRC menus for SG13G2, you could set your desired options as shown below:

For additional details on GUI options, please refer to the [CLI Options section](#cli).

Finally, after setting your option, you could execute the DRC using `Run Klayout DRC` from the dropdown menu.

Upon executing the DRC, the result database will appear on your layout interface, allowing you to verify the outcome of the run.

**NOTE**

The current SG13G2 DRC rules are categorized as follows:

- **Minimum Rule Set** ‚Äì Refer to the [README](docs/MinList.md):  
  This set contains the essential DRC rules that are required for baseline verification. All rules in this category have been thoroughly verified, tested, and optimized for performance.

- **Maximum Rule Set** ‚Äì Refer to the [README](docs/MaxList.md):  
  This set includes additional residual rules that are not part of the minimum set. These rules can be activated by using the `--MaxRuleSet` switch when executing the DRC. Please note that these rules have not been verified or tested.

- **Missing Rule Set** ‚Äì Refer to the [README](docs/MissingList.md):  
  This set lists the DRC rules that have not yet been implemented.
